## Summary of Insights

#### Sales

* Our best-performing weeks are in Q4 and Q3 across almost all metrics over the years. Both sales and profits are consistently above the yearly average starting around week 35 (late August).

* We've had profit losses for all years in our Tables subcategory despite it being one of our top sellers. The maximum profit loss we saw was $8k in 2023.

#### Customers

* Our customer base is growing steadily, but years where we see an increase in repeat business has a drop in new customer acquisition.

* Each year, our top customers make a few high-value orders. Rankings show significant changes in the top customers also.


## Recommendations & Next Steps

* Investigate why our sales are so seasonal. How do we boost Q2 and Q1 sales to make our year-round performance more consistent? How can we sell our existing products more consistently, or expand our offerings? Are there undertapped consumer bases we could tap into - such as local schools getting new supplies over the summer?

* Investigate the costs involved in Table sales and possible ways to reduce them. Do our customers buy enough other products in combined purchases, if any, to have a high-enough overall profit offset the loss?

* Are there marketing differences between those years? How can we increase resources and/or efficiency to achieve both?

* What products or markets are they buying that aren't from us? What new products can we offer to complement their historical purchases and needs?

* Investigate the top customer turnover rates. How many of these customers come from the same companies? Do we have brand loyalty only from individuals, or also companies? Is it possible to secure a steady supplier contract with them?
